What if some 4-5 monkeys are typing random characters from keyboard? Our goal is to find out our target string using Genetic Algorithm.

What is Genetic Algorithm? 
The genetic algorithm is a method for solving both constrained and unconstrained optimization problems that is based on natural selection, the process that drives biological evolution. The genetic algorithm repeatedly modifies a population of individual solutions.
